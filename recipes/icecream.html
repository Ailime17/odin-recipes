        <p>This Vegan Ice Cream is rich, creamy, and incredible easy to make with only 5 ingredients!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup raw cashews soaked in water overnight, drained</li>
            <li>2 cans of full fat coconut milk , (two 13.4 ounce cans) </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vanilla bean paste , or extract or 1 vanilla bean</li>
            <li>2/3 cup cane sugar , or other granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon sea salt </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Ensure your cashews are completely soaked from before. Also ensure your ice cream maker freezer base is in the freezer for at least 7 to 24 hours before (preferably 24 hours) .</li>
            <li>In a high speed blender, blend the soaked cashews, coconut milk, vanilla bean paste, cane sugar and the sea salt together until completely smooth, about 2-4 minutes on high speed depending on your blender. You want to ensure it’s 100% smooth, so feel free to blend longer until you’re sure all the cashews are blended out.</li>
            <li>Pour mixture into a bowl, container or leave in the blender and cover. Sometimes the mixture can get hot while blending. Place it in the fridge for 4 hours in the coldest spot, up to 2 days if you don't plan to make the ice cream immediately.</li>
            <li>Remove from the fridge. Set up your ice cream machine and place the ice cream maker freezer base into the machine and pour the ice cream mixture in. Prepare according to manufacturer settings, for about 20-25 minutes of churning. The mixture should be thick and smooth.</li>
        </ol>
